PIG-GAME RULES:

- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as manu times as he wishes. Each result gets added to his ROUND score
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The player can choose to "hold", which means that his ROUND scorre gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn.
- The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game
